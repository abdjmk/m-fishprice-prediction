Introduction: Define the regression problem of predicting monthly fish prices, and choose MSE and MAE as evaluation indicators. The goal of this project is to develop a mobile application to provide price forecasts and recommendations.

Dataset description and preprocessing: use historical fish price data in 2005 and other influencing factors to deal with outliers and missing values, construct new features, and make the target variable "Weekly_price" close to normal distribution. Delete the columns "LANDED_WEIGHT_KG", "LIVE_WEIGHT_KG" and "VALUE_MEXICAN_PESOS".

Mobile application prototype design: Design a 5-screen mobile application, including 1) data overview, showing the change of fish price over time; 2) price forecast, uploading weeks to get the predicted price; 3) price history, showing the past price trend ; 4) Price distribution, the histogram shows the price range distribution; 5) Price recommendation, a reasonable price range is obtained based on the current price.

Diagram and explanation of machine learning models: use linear regression, KNN, random forest to explain the principles and mathematical principles of each algorithm, and draw model diagrams.

Actual implementation and comparison of models: train three models, tune hyperparameters, compare MSE and MAE on the test set, and select the two models with the best results. Plot a scatterplot of predicted prices versus actual prices to visually check performance.

Conclusion and future work: Summarize the results, evaluate the predictive effect of the selected model, discuss the shortcomings and room for improvement, such as using longer time range data, adding other features, etc.
